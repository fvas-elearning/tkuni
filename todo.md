##Questions for the Folio Gang:


  1. Are the Placements, records related by a course or student cohort in the DB?
  2. Are the entries editable via staff?
  3. How do you assign student to staff/Tutors?
  4. How do you plan to integrate the software into your staff workflow?
     When will the staff add an entry (before/after placement)
     When does a student add an entry?
     Is there any submission constraints entered into the code.
       (ie: date after entries can be added)
  5.
