## Installation

Start by getting the dependant libs:

~~~bash
# git clone https://github.com/tropotek/tkuni.git
# cd tkuni
# composer install
~~~

This should prompt you to answer a few questions and create the src/config/config.php and .htaccess files.

If this fails you need to create your own .htaccess (copy the .htaccess.in) and config.php (copy the config.php.in)

Also you will have to run the command bin/cmd migrate to install the DB.
